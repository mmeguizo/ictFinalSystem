Focused Agenda: Digitalization, System Development
INTRODUCTION
The rapid digital transformation in Philippine State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) has intensified the need for
efficient service delivery within ICT departments, which play a central role in supporting academic and administrative
functions (Espinosa, 2023; World Bank, 2024). However, the sector faces persistent challenges, including inadequate
ICT infrastructure, limited digital skills among staff and students, and outdated operational models that hinder the
responsive management of service requests (PIDS, 2020; Espinosa, 2023). These issues are further compounded by
insufficient funding, lack of qualified personnel, and fragmented systems, making ICT service monitoring and analysis
a critical pain point for most SUCs (PHJLIS, 2023; World Bank, 2024).
Against this backdrop, this research proposes the design and development of an intelligent service request monitoring
and analysis platform tailored for ICT departments for Philippine SUCs. The proposed platform seeks to address critical
issues such as delays, manual tracking bottlenecks, inefficient workflow assignment, and the absence of actionable
analytics, all of which undermine service quality and accountability (Studocu, 2023; PIDS, 2020). By automating the
logging, tracking, prioritizing, and analysis of ICT service requests, the platform is envisioned as a key innovation that
streamlines internal operations, facilitates better communication, and empowers ICT managers with real-time
performance metrics.
The investigation aligns directly with national and institutional research agendas around digital transformation, egovernance, and improved technology management in higher education (World Bank, 2024; Ombudsman/UNDP,
2013). Specifically, it supports objectives articulated by the Commission on Higher Education and various digitalization
initiatives that prioritize robust ICT infrastructure, access, and governance reforms for SUCs (World Bank, 2024; PIDS,
2020).
This research is significant as it does not merely investigate the current barriers to service request management, but
innovates by developing a centralized, intelligent platform designed to achieve three core outcomes: (1) improved
service turnaround through automation and analytics, (2) greater transparency and accountability in ICT operations,
and (3) actionable insights for evidence-based planning. The investigation will focus on inventing practical workflows
and intelligent rule-based assignment algorithms tailored for resource-constrained ICT offices.
There is a clear and urgent need to innovate, as current manual and semi-digital approaches are unable to meet the
demands of increasingly complex university operations, thereby limiting institutional capacity for service delivery,
stakeholder satisfaction, and digital maturity (PIDS, 2020; World Bank, 2024). This research aims to provide a scalable
model and system that can be adapted and adopted by other SUCs, advancing both national digital transformation
goals and local institutional excellence in ICT service management.

Research Objectives / Problem Statements
The general objective of the study is to design and develop an intelligent service request monitoring and analysis
platform that streamlines and enhances the effectiveness, transparency, and responsiveness of ICT service delivery
and management thereby addressing existing challenges in service tracking, workload assignment, and real-time
analytics within resource-constrained academic environments.
Specifically, it also aimed to:
1. design and develop Energy Building Management System with following technical features:

integration with existing ICT service management practices and will primarily involve staff and stakeholders
from selected SUC campuses during pilot implementation and validation phases. The coverage includes
collation of service request data, analysis of patterns, and provision of performance dashboards for ICT
managers and administrators.
The study is limited to the ICT service support and management functions and does not cover full
enterprise resource planning (ERP) or other university-wide transactions outside the ICT department.
Implementation will be constrained by the quality and completeness of existing service request data, as
well as user adoption and technological readiness in individual SUCs. The platform’s evaluation will be
restricted to short- to medium-term impacts on efficiency, transparency, and stakeholder satisfaction;
external factors such as institutional funding, internet infrastructure, and policy changes are outside the
direct scope of the system’s design and assessment. Furthermore, the generalizability of outcomes may
be limited due to institutional differences in ICT maturity and management capacity across Philippine SUCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS (Design, procedures, instruments, participants/subjects, etc..)
RESEARCH DESIGN
This study will employ a combination of developmental and descriptive research designs to achieve its
objectives. The developmental research design will guide the systematic process of creating the Intelligent
Service Request Monitoring and Analysis Platform, ensuring that each step of analysis, design, system
prototyping, and iterative refinement aligns with best software engineering and educational technology
standards (Scribbr, 2023). The development phase will include requirement gathering from ICT stakeholders,
system architecture design, module coding, pilot testing, and incremental improvement based on feedback
from pilot adopters in selected SUCs.
The study will utilize the Iterative Development Model depicted in Figure 2. This system development is a
cyclic and evolutionary approach to system development, emphasizing continuous refinement through
repeated cycles of planning, implementation, evaluation, and verification (Atkinson & Hummel, 2012; Ali,
2020).

Verification involves rigorous testing of developed modules against requirements. This includes unit and
integration tests, as well as user acceptance testing, to ensure each feature performs as intended.
Evaluation
Feedback from stakeholders and end users is gathered through reviews and pilot testing. Insights from this
evaluation are fed back into the planning stage, promoting ongoing system improvement.
Deployment
Once verified and evaluated, the platform is deployed within the ICT department’s operational environment.
The model allows for further iterations even after deployment, ensuring the platform remains responsive to
emerging needs and challenges.
This approach is particularly well-suited for complex ICT systems in academic institutions, as it encourages
stakeholder collaboration, allows for incremental delivery of features, and supports rapid adaptation to
feedback and changing requirements. By using the Iterative Development Model, the platform can evolve
alongside institutional needs, achieving higher reliability, user satisfaction, and operational effectiveness.
